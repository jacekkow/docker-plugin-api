# Docker Plugin API in Python

This module contains some abstractions to simplify creation
of own plugins for Docker Engine.

It currently contains entities for:

- Plugin,
- IpamDriver,
- NetworkDriver.

## Examples

Check out https://github.com/jacekkow/docker-plugin-ipam
for a real-life plugin that uses this API.
